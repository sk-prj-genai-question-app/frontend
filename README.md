## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
- npm

### 2. Installation

In the project root directory, run the following command to install dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration

You need to set the address of the backend API server. Create a `.env.development` file in the project root and enter the API server address as shown below.

```
# .env.development
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 
```
> **Note**: This variable is used in files like `src/api/axios.js` in the format `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

### 4. Running the Development Server

Run the command below to start the Vite development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```
Once the server starts, you can access it at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📜 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Runs the Vite server in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production, creating the output in the `dist` folder.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code style using ESLint.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

## 🐳 Running in Production with Docker

This project supports a multi-stage Docker build that serves static files using Nginx.

1.  **Build the Docker image**
    ```bash
    docker build -t jlpt-frontend:latest .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 jlpt-frontend:latest
    ```
    You can now access the production-built application at `http://localhost`.
